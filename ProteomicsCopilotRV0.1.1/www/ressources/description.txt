@Project Nummer:@
CFMS000032

@Sample Material:@
Lyophylized cells in 15 ml tubes; 16 samples

@Sample Processing:@
Lysed with varying volumes (40-100 µl, according to estimated cell numbers) of 4% SDC in 100 mM Tris/HCl pH=8.5;
Boiled for 10 min at 95°C in 15 ml tubes;
Transfer in Dyanode ultrasonication PP-tubes;
Sonication: standard 10 cycles 30 sec on / 30 sec off;
Protein concentrations determined by BCA, all in suitable range (0.52 - 1.2 µg/µl);
10 µg each reduced with TCEP and alkylated with CAM;
Reduced and alkylated samples subjected to SP3 standard proteocol protein enrichment;
Digest with Trp/LysC at 1:50 in 50 mM ABC buffer overnight;
Acifified with 1% TFA;
Peptide clean-up with C18-StageTips;
Peptide concentrations and ratios determined by A280 measurement (Nanodrop), ranges and ratios all suitable for measurements;
Diluted to 200 ng/ µl with MS load buffer and 1µ used for injections

@Exceptional Events:@
Sample_07 (=74067_W-VB3) showed a huge contamination with polymer peaks (suspected to have plastic particles inside), as a result only few peptide/protein identifications were recorded;
Processing of sample_07 was redone and remeasured (raw-file indicated with ...ReDo...);
Protein identifications in sample_07 repeat was comparable to the other samples, no polymer peaks dtected in remeasurement

@LC-MS/MS Analysis:@
Reverse-phase liquid chromatography (Bruker nanoElute) coupled to Bruker timsTOF HT, operated in DIA-PASEF mode;
Gradient length: 60 min., mobile phases water/0.1% FA and ACN/0.1% FA;
Column: 15 cm C18 in-house packed;
Acquisition method: DIA, standard PASEF windows for 1h gradient

@Processing Software:@
DIANN (Version_1.8)
16 raw-files (including sample_07 remeasurement);
Paramters: default parameters (FDR(%)=1.0; static modification: Cys-CAM; dynamic modification: Met-Ox; match-between-runs (MBR) set to NO; allowed two missed cleavages; FASTA = mus-musculus_uniprotkb_proteome_UP000000589_2024_07_31_C57Bl6J, from 07-2024 
 
 
 
 
 
Altogether 10,576 protein groups were identified in the data set
